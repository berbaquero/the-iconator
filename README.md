# The Web Boilerplate

> A simple, small and React-based boilerplate for web projects

Primarily using React for dynamic _and_ static UI building and Sass for CSS pre-processing.

### Get it

Just hit the '**Download ZIP**' button to get the project and start from there!

_If you `git clone` the repo, you'll get the development history from it, which you probably don't want for your own project._

### Run it

Run these commands on your terminal to use the boilerplate

```coffee
npm install # to get the required packages

npm start # to develop

npm run build # to build the whole project
```

### Work it

You have 3 main working folders, located inside the `app` folder:

* `scripts` — contains all your JS modules and JSX components
* `styles` — contains all your 
* `templates` — contains the React components that will be rendered to static HTML files.

### React for static HTML files

Besides using React for building your dynamic UIs, this boilerplate also uses React for creating any JSX component in the `app/templates` folder into static HTML files. So the whole UI building is done in one awesome consistent way.

To create HTML files from React, just run on your terminal:

```coffee
# on project root
npm run build-statics
```

This will execute `node build.js` which reads `statics.json` to render the React components into HTML files.

### `statics.json`

This is the main config file for defining which React components from the `templates` folder will be rendered into HTML files, on which directories and its names.

The `files` property is a list of objects that define this behavior by using these properties:
* `template`: the name of the React JSX component in the `templates` folder, without file extensions (`.jsx`).
* `path`: the file-path on which to create the resulting HTML file. Will create the folders defined here as necessary.
* `name`: (optional) the name of the resulting HTML file. If not defined, will be the same as `template`.


#### Limitations for React components for static HTML compiling
* The component files must have the `.jsx` extension.
* When `require`-ing / `import`-ing these components inside other components, the extension must be left out. For example: `var Component = require('./component');` even though the filename is `component.jsx`.
